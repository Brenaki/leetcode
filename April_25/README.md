# 2235. Add Two Integers

- Given two integers `num1` and `num2`, return the **sum** of the two integers.

##### Example:

* **Input:** num1 = 12, num2 = 5
* **Output:** 17
* **Explanatio:** num1 is 12, num2 is 5, and their sum is 12 + 5 = 17, so 17 is returned.

##### Constraints:

- `-100<= num1, num2 <= 100`

#### Solution:

- [Code](./2235.ts)

# 2544. Alternating Digit Sum

- You are given a positive integer `n`. Each digit of `n` has a sign according to the following rules:
	- The **most significant digit** is assigned a **positive** sign.
	- Each other digit has an opposite sign to its adjacent digits.
- Return *the sum all digits with their corresponding sign*.

##### Example 1:

* Input: n = 521
* Output: 4
* Explanation: (+5) + (-2) + (+1) = 4

##### Example 2:

* **Input:** n = 111
* **Output:** 1
* **Explanation:** (+1) + (-1) + (+1) = 1.

##### Constraints:

- `1<= n <= 10⁹`

#### Solution:

- [Code](./2544.ts)
